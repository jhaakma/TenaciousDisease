# Tenacious Disease
A Morrowind mod that makes diseases scale to player attributes and get worse over time.

# Effect Scaling

Disease effects are converted to a percentage of the player's base attributes. This percentage starts at 0% when the disease is initially contracted, and slowly progresses until reaching 100%. 

The rate of progression is based on the strength of the initial disease (separate for each attribute drain), the player's Endurance, and the resistDisease effect. 

# Curing

Resist Disease, in addition to preventing contraction of diseases, also helps to slow progression of a contracted Disease. 

Cure Disease no longer removes the symptoms right away. Symptoms take time to recover, taking longer the more the disease has progressed.
