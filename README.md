# Tenacious Disease
A Morrowind mod that makes diseases scale to player attributes and get worse over time.

# Effect Scaling

Disease effects are converted to a percentage of the player's base attributes. This percentage starts at 0% when the disease is initially contracted, and slowly progresses until reaching 100%. 

The rate of progression is based on the strength of the initial disease (separate for each attribute drain), the player's Endurance, and the resistDisease effect. 

# Resistance and Curing

Resist Disease, in addition to helping prevent disease, also helps to slow progression of a contracted Disease. 

Cure Disease no longer removes the symptoms right away. Symptoms take time to recover, taking longer the more the disease has progressed. (Note: A future Ashfall feature may add teas that can instantly cure specific diseases).

# Decals

As a disease progresses, it may produce visible symptoms on the player's skin. These decals may be unique for vanilla or registered diseases, or randomly chosen for others. 

# Notifications

You are no longer notified when you initially contract a disease. 

When symptoms start to appear hours or days later, you may recieve a message saying "You don't feel so good.".

(Note: the Ashfall Addition may include a Medicine Skill which will hide the name of a disease unless your skill is high enough to diagnose).
